Driveline/MLB data

# Problem Statement
The goal of this research is to highlight biomechanical interactions that baseball hitters demonstrate to affect bat speed, an already proven metric that positively impacts performance. In doing so, I will attempt to distinguish potential differences between different sequencing types, body masses, right-handed and left-handed hitters to determine if certain biomechanics should be altered. Using findings from the OpenBiomechanics Driveline data, I took bat speed findings and applied them to MLB data from Baseball Savant.


# Variables of Interest
- 'exit_velo_mph_x' : exit velocity (miles per hour)
- 'blast_bat_speed_mph_x' : bat speed at contact as measured by Blast Motion sensor (miles per hour)
- 'pelvis_angular_velocity_fm_x' : pelvis angular velocity at first move (deg/sec) 
- 'pelvis_angular_velocity_fp_x': pelvis angular velocity at foot plant (deg/sec)
- 'torso_angular_velocity_fm_x' : torso angular velocity at first move (deg/sec) 
- 'torso_angular_velocity_fp_x' : torso angular velocity at foot plant (deg/sec)
- 'upper_arm_speed_mag_fm_x' : resultant upper arm speed at first move (deg/sec) 
- 'upper_arm_speed_mag_fp_x' : resultant upper arm speed at foot plant (deg/sec)
- 'hand_speed_mag_fm_x' : resultant hand speed at first move (deg/sec) 
- 'hand_speed_mag_fp_x': resultant hand speed at foot plant (deg/sec) 
- 'x_factor_fp_z' : x-factor angle (z) at foot plant (same as torso-pelvis angle) - using K-Vest conventions (deg)
- 'max_cog_velo_x' : maximum center of gravity velocity from start of take to end of take (meters per second)
