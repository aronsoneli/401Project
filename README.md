# 401Project
Driveline/MLB data

# Problem Statement
The goal of this research is to highlight biomechanical interactions that baseball hitters demonstrate to affect bat speed, an already proven metric that positively impacts performance. In doing so, I will attempt to distinguish potential differences between right-handed and left-handed hitters to determine if certain biomechanics should be altered based on batting side. Using findings from the OpenBiomechanics Driveline data, I will then make conclusions using MLB data.


# Variables of Interest
- 'exit_velo_mph_x' : exit velocity (miles per hour)
- 'blast_bat_speed_mph_x' : bat speed at contact as measured by Blast Motion sensor (miles per hour)
- 'attack_angle_contact_x': vertical attack angle at contact (deg)
- 'torso_angle_fp_z' : torso angle (z) at foot plant - using K-Vest conventions (deg)
- 'x_factor_fp_z' : x-factor angle (z) at foot plant (same as torso-pelvis angle) - using K-Vest conventions (deg)
- 'torso_launchpos_z' : torso angle (z) at foot plant (deg)
